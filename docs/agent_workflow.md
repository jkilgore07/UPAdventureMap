 here’s a lightweight but scalable way to keep every AI “employee,” junior split-off, and trusted MCP working in lock-step without drowning you in meta-work.

1. 3-Loop Workflow
Loop	Human action	Architect meta-agent	Resulting state
Define	You describe a new or changed task.	/scan → spots the gap → /draft {task} returns Agent-Spec JSON.	Spec goes to the Agent Roster ledger.
Spawn	Copy the JSON block into your Prompt-Generator → open new “Windsurf” chat → paste as system prompt.	—	New agent begins work, inherits MCP tokens & task list from its spec.
Report / Audit	—	Each agent appends log events to the Central Ledger (see below). A dedicated Agent-Manager agent tails that ledger on a 1-min cron, runs consistency checks, and pings you only if something is off.	Single source of truth is always current.

2. Central “Ledger” File
Keep one machine-readable file in a private Git repo or Notion database; everything else is derived from it.

// agent_roster_and_task_ledger.jsonl   (one JSON per line)
{
  "ts": "2025-06-20T15:02:11Z",
  "kind": "spec-publish",
  "agent": "MapsLayerSenior",
  "payload_ref": "specs/MapsLayerSenior_v3.json"
}
{
  "ts": "2025-06-20T15:04:09Z",
  "kind": "task-claim",
  "agent": "MapsLayerSenior",
  "task_id": "MAP-104",
  "note": "Will generate Day-03 KML layer"
}
{
  "ts": "2025-06-20T15:07:55Z",
  "kind": "output-commit",
  "agent": "MapsLayerSenior",
  "artefact": "kml/Day03.kml",
  "git_sha": "d13ab77"
}
Why JSON-lines?
Append-only, diff-friendly, and trivial for every language (and ChatGPT) to parse.

A single source can be streamed to dashboards, slack bots, or the Agent-Manager without race conditions.

3. The Agent-Manager Agent
Mission

Poll agent_roster_and_task_ledger.jsonl.

Validate every new event against business rules:

Each open Trello/Notion task is claimed by ≥ 1 senior agent.

No agent writes outside its outputs scope.

Juniors log every action under a supervising senior’s task_id.

Emit only three kinds of messages:

:white_check_mark: daily digest (all green).

:warning: mis-match or stale task (> 24 h inactivity).

:x: violation (e.g., writes to unapproved MCP endpoint).

Implementation tip—the Manager can be a tiny Python worker container scheduled by GitHub Actions or the same trusted MCP (if it exposes cron-style “agent jobs”).

4. Minimal Agent Contract
Every agent (senior or junior) must:

Read-only the whole ledger.

Append its own events (never delete).

Follow the event-type schema above (extend if needed, but document!).

Run pre-commit lint before pushing artefacts; violations block output-commit events.

5. Commands Cheat-Sheet (for you)
Action	You type	Effect
See current staffing & task map	Architect → /scan	Prints table of tasks → agents.
Get draft spec for a new task	Architect → /draft MAP-122	Returns JSON block(s).
Push spec to repo	git add specs/...; git commit -m "Add UXReview_Senior"; git push	Ledger gains spec-publish.
Spawn new worker	Open new Windsurf chat, paste JSON as system prompt	Child agent kicks off.
Check health	Agent-Manager auto-posts #agent-feed	You skim only exceptions.

6. Where to Keep Human-Readable Notes?
Let automation own the ledger; let humans read dashboards.

Docs site / Notion page auto-built from the ledger (simple Jinja template).

The Architect prints a pretty org-chart on each /publish.

Anything ad-hoc? Drop it in comments; the next /scan pulls it into context.

TL;DR
One append-only ledger = no confusion.

Architect proposes → you approve → spawn agent.

Agent-Manager audits the ledger, keeps chatter down to the exceptions.

Juniors are just smaller specs; promotion = spec-update event.

Follow that pattern and scaling from 5 to 50 agents is mostly painless—you’re treating them the same way engineering teams treat micro-services with CI logs.
